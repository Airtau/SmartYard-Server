> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you use VM, set CPU type to "HOST" for this VM.

apt-get install -y clickhouse-server clickhouse-client
```

[default password is: ```qqq```]

```bash
systemctl start clickhouse-server
```

Initialize the database:

```bash
php /opt/rbt/server/cli.php --init-clickhouse-db
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> If you have problems writing data to the ```plog``` table (events in the mobile app), then try running next query:
>
> ```clickhouse
> SELECT isValidJSON('{}')
> ```
>
> If you get the error message:
>
> ```
> DB::Exception: Couldn't allocate 2 bytes when parsing JSON: In scope SELECT isValidJSON('{}'). (CANNOT_ALLOCATE_MEMORY)
> ```
>
> make sure you set the CPU type to "HOST" if you are using a VM.
> If that doesn't help, or you are not using a VM, then the server probably has an old CPU.
>
> In this case, try disabling the ```simdjson``` library,
> go to ```/etc/clickhouse-server/users.xml```
> and add ```<allow_simdjson>0</allow_simdjson>``` to the default profile settings, then restart the service.
